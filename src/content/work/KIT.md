**Company:** Ki10 Games

### Project Overview
*KIT - Knight in Training* is my debut independent title, currently in active development at my own studio, Ki10 Games. It is an action-adventure game where I am channeling my nine years of industry experience into every facet of its creation. The goal is to build a polished and engaging experience that reflects a deep understanding of both game development and player expectations.

### My Role & Responsibilities
As the Director of the project, my role encompasses the full spectrum of game development, requiring me to leverage and expand upon my entire career skillset. My responsibilities are divided into three core areas:
* **Game Design:** I am leading all design efforts, developing the core gameplay systems, shaping the narrative direction, and continuously refining the player experience based on a clear internal vision.
* **Programming:** I have taken full ownership of programming the game in Unity. This includes building features, debugging complex issues, optimising performance, and integrating third party tools and frameworks.
* **Quality Assurance:** Drawing on my extensive background, I am creating and executing all test plans, cases, and scripts to ensure optimal test coverage. I am also maintaining a detailed QA knowledge base for the project.

### The Challenge
The ultimate challenge of being an independent developer is wearing multiple hats effectively. The project requires a constant shift in mindset from the creative thinking of a designer, to the logical problem solving of a programmer, to the critical and methodical analysis of a QA tester. Balancing these demanding roles while making steady progress on the project is the core challenge I am currently navigating.

### My Approach & Actions
* **Design:** I am building the game's foundation by developing its core systems and narrative, focusing on creating a fun and intuitive player experience from the ground up.
* **Programming:** I am actively writing, debugging, and optimising the game's code, applying my deep understanding of game stability and performance to my own work.
* **Testing:** I am implementing a professional grade QA process for my own project, creating robust test plans and maintaining a knowledge base to track issues, test data, and platform specific behaviors.

### Impact & Results
* **(Project is in development)** My direct, hands-on control over all three core disciplines design, programming, and QA is ensuring that a quality first mindset is embedded in every aspect of the game from its inception.
* This project represents the culmination of my professional journey, allowing me to apply nearly a decade of lessons learned in the games industry to create a product that I am truly passionate about.

### Technologies & Tools Used
* **Unity Engine**
* **Jira** (for bug and task tracking)
* **Confluence** (for design documentation and QA knowledge base)
* **C# / Unity Programming**
* **PC & Console Development Kits**
