**Company:** Team 17 (Publisher) / Pathea Games (Developer)

### Project Overview
*My Time at Portia* is a popular 3D sandbox, role playing, and life simulation game. As the publisher, Team 17 was responsible for ensuring the quality and successful launch of the title across PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. My role was to provide thorough QA testing, with a strong focus on platform compliance and functional stability.

### My Role & Responsibilities
This project marked several firsts for me, requiring me to quickly adapt to new tools and genres. My key responsibilities included:
* **Unity Engine Testing:** This was my first project using the Unity engine, which involved learning the nuances of a new development environment.
* **Multi Platform Compliance:** I was heavily involved in compliance testing for all platforms (Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo), expanding on my previous experience to ensure the game met each platform holder's strict technical requirements.
* **Genre Adaptation:** I quickly got up to speed with the mechanics and player expectations of the farming and life simulator genre.
* **Test Documentation:** I took an active role in creating and maintaining test documentation, including detailed test plans for in game items and playthrough guides.

### The Challenge
The main challenge was the steep learning curve associated with a new game engine, a new bug tracking tool (Redmine), and a completely new genre. Additionally, ensuring the game passed the rigorous and distinct compliance checks for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo simultaneously required meticulous attention to detail and a deep understanding of each platform holder's specific rules.

### Gameplay Highlights

Here is a highlight of the crafting gameplay I was responsible for testing.

### My Approach & Actions
* **Accelerated Learning:** I dedicated myself to mastering the Unity engine's specific behaviours and the Redmine bug tracking workflow to become an effective member of the team.
* **Authored Robust Test Plans:** I created comprehensive Excel test sheets for all in game items and collectibles, providing a clear and structured way to track testing progress and reported issues.
* **Constructed Playthrough Guides:** I helped build detailed playthrough documents in Confluence, ensuring all critical story events and the golden path were consistently tested by the team.
* **Applied Compliance Expertise:** Leveraging my previous experience with Sony's requirements, I became a go to tester for compliance checks across all platforms, ensuring the game was ready for submission.
* **Conducted Deep Exploratory Testing:** My thorough testing of game mechanics led me to discover a nasty soft lock bug related to losing key items that had been previously overlooked.

### Impact & Results
* My ability to quickly learn the Unity engine and new tools allowed me to **contribute effectively to the project from day one.**
* The detailed test plans and playthrough documents I created **improved the structure and efficiency of the team's testing efforts.**
* My expertise in compliance testing was recognized by the team and **helped ensure a smooth submission process** across all console platforms.
* I was praised by colleagues for discovering a **critical, progression blocking bug** that, if missed, would have significantly impacted players and required a post launch patch.

### Technologies & Tools Used
* **Redmine** (for bug tracking and reporting)
* **Microsoft Excel** (for test cases and checklists)
* **Confluence** (for test plans and QA knowledge base)
* **Unity Engine**
* **Console Development Kits:** PlayStation 4, Xbox One, & Nintendo Switch
