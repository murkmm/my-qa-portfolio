### Project Overview
*Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX* is a modern remake of the beloved SEGA Master System classic. As a publisher QA Tester, I was part of a team responsible for managing multiple concurrent projects, ensuring this nostalgic title met the high standards expected by both the IP holder and a new generation of players.

### My Role & Responsibilities
My role involved a blend of hands-on testing, planning, and mentorship. I performed full compliance passes on all major platforms, created comprehensive test plans and guides for internal and external partners, and mentored colleagues on industry-standard testing practices and platform holder requirements.

### The Challenge
The main challenge was balancing the testing needs of multiple concurrent projects while ensuring a title with such a nostalgic legacy was a polished and faithful remake. This required deep research into each project's needs and meticulous planning to meet submission deadlines.

### My Approach & Actions

* I mentored junior colleagues, guiding them on best practices for both functional and compliance testing.

### Impact & Results
* My thorough compliance testing ensured a smooth and successful submission process across all platforms.
* The test documentation I created became a key resource, improving the efficiency and consistency of both internal and external test teams.
* My feedback helped the development partner address key issues, contributing to a higher-quality final product that was well-received by fans of the original.
