### Project Overview
*Hyenas* was an ambitious, session-based multiplayer PvPvE shooter. As a member of the core QA team, I had a holistic view of the project, working closely with all departments to ensure the quality and stability of the game during its active development. Although the project was ultimately cancelled, my time on it was a valuable experience in testing large-scale, live-service titles.

### My Role & Responsibilities
My role was to act as a versatile QA Technician, providing broad testing coverage and feedback. Key duties included running daily smoke tests on all target platforms, creating clear and concise bug reports, reviewing existing issues to ensure accurate prioritization, and organizing regular multiplayer play sessions to test the core gameplay loop.

### The Challenge
The primary challenge was testing a complex, new IP with many interconnected systems while it was in a constant state of flux. Identifying potential risks early by interfacing with design and development experts was crucial to focusing our test efforts where they would have the most impact.

### My Approach & Actions
* I executed daily smoke tests to quickly validate the health of each new build.
* I worked directly with development leads to identify and communicate high-risk areas.
* I authored detailed bug reports with clear reproduction steps, build notes, and video evidence.
* I organized and participated in daily multiplayer playtests to provide direct feedback on the game's quality, stability, and overall player experience.

### Impact & Results
* My consistent smoke testing and clear bug reporting helped the team rapidly identify and fix critical issues, improving daily build stability.
* My proactive communication with domain experts ensured that QA's efforts were always aligned with the project's most immediate risks and priorities.
* The feedback gathered from the play sessions I organized was instrumental in refining the core gameplay loop during the development process.

### Technologies & Tools Used
* **Jira** (for bug tracking and reporting)
* **Confluence** (for test documentation)
* **Unreal Engine 5**
* **PC & Console Development Kits**
