I designed and implemented end-to-end test strategies for both internal and external teams, managed the development of all test materials, and undertook the prioritization of workloads to drive team engagement.

### The Challenge

* I served as the primary QA voice in meetings, providing status reports and offering insights to refine future testing strategies.

### Impact & Results
