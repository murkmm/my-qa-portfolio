### Project Overview
*FORECLOSED* is a narrative-driven action-adventure game set in a cyberpunk world, defined by its unique interactive comic book aesthetic. In my role as a publisher QA Tester, I was responsible for the end-to-end testing of the title, ensuring its unique visual style and gameplay were polished for release on all major platforms.

### My Role & Responsibilities
I was tasked with the full functional and compliance testing of the game, working closely with the production team to meet deadlines. A key part of my role was to provide clear, actionable feedback to the external development partner and to create detailed test plans for the wider test team.

### The Challenge
The main challenge was thoroughly testing the game's unique visual and gameplay mechanics, which were heavily inspired by graphic novels. This required a keen eye for artistic and stylistic bugs, in addition to standard functional testing, all while managing the strict compliance requirements of multiple platforms.

### My Approach & Actions
* I performed comprehensive testing passes on the game to ensure a high-quality and bug-free user experience.
* I conducted full compliance checks against Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo guidelines.
* I researched the game's mechanics to create targeted test plans and guides for the rest of the team.
* I mentored other testers, sharing my knowledge of platform-specific requirements to improve the team's overall effectiveness.

### Impact & Results
* My detailed feedback helped the development team refine the game's unique mechanics and visual presentation.
* My mentorship increased the compliance knowledge of the wider team, leading to more efficient testing cycles on future projects.
* My work contributed to a successful multi-platform launch that was praised for its innovative art style.
