**Company:** 22 Cans

### Project Overview
*Legacy* is an innovative business simulation game where players invent, create, and manage a company. My role was unique as I served as the primary QA contact embedded directly within the development team, responsible for ensuring quality and stability throughout the production phases.

### My Role & Responsibilities
As the main QA point person, I managed the full lifecycle of bug reporting, including triaging, logging, and tracking issues. I developed and executed targeted test strategies focused on the core simulation and progression systems and coordinated with external QA teams to align testing priorities.

### The Challenge
The challenge of being the primary embedded QA was balancing a wide range of responsibilities. I had to be both a hands-on tester and a strategic planner, managing the flow of information between the internal development team and external QA partners while ensuring a tight feedback loop for rapid issue resolution.

### My Approach & Actions
* I provided continuous, direct feedback on design implementation and user experience to the development team.
* I developed and executed specific test strategies to validate the complex simulation and progression mechanics.
* I managed the entire bug database, ensuring all issues were clearly documented, tracked, and verified.
* I served as the central point of contact for external QA teams, aligning their testing priorities with the project's current needs.

### Impact & Results
* My position as an embedded QA tester **created a highly efficient, tight feedback loop**, which significantly reduced bug resolution times.
* My continuous feedback on design and UX **contributed directly to iterative improvements** throughout the development process.
* My coordination efforts ensured that the work of external QA teams was always **aligned with the project's priorities**, maximizing their effectiveness.

### Technologies & Tools Used
* **Monday** (defect tracking and project managment)
* **Confluence** (for test plans and QA knowledge base)
* **Unity Engine**
* **PC and Mac**
