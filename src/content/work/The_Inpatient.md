**Company:** Supermassive Games / Sony Interactive Entertainment

### Project Overview
*The Inpatient* was a psychological horror game developed exclusively for PlayStation VR and served as a narrative prequel to the hit title *Until Dawn*. The project's goal was to leverage the immersive power of VR to create a tense, atmospheric experience where player choice directly impacted the game's branching storyline.

### My Role & Responsibilities
As a core member of the development QA team, this project represented my first venture into the world of virtual reality testing. My responsibilities included:
* **Mastering VR Testing:** Quickly learning the unique challenges and requirements of testing on the PlayStation VR platform, including comfort, performance, and hardware specific issues.
* **Coordinating a Hybrid Team:** Taking a leadership role in onboarding several testers from Sony's internal QA team, assigning their daily tasks, and getting them up to speed on the project.
* **Creating Test Documentation:** Authoring detailed test plans and guides in Confluence to facilitate collaboration between our core team and a remote testing team based in Liverpool.
* **Narrative & Lore Integrity:** Paying exceptionally close attention to story details to ensure all references and plot points were consistent with the established lore of the *Until Dawn* franchise, a key expectation for the dedicated fanbase.

### The Challenge
The primary challenge was adapting to an entirely new platform. Testing in VR for the first time required a complete shift in approach, focusing on player comfort and immersion in addition to standard functionality. Furthermore, coordinating a distributed team of both in house, embedded, and remote testers presented logistical challenges that demanded clear, concise documentation and strong communication to ensure everyone was aligned.

### My Approach & Actions
* **Became a VR Platform Expert:** I dedicated myself to learning the ins and outs of VR testing, quickly becoming a knowledgeable and efficient tester on the new hardware.
* **Mentored and Led New Testers:** I took the initiative to guide the incoming Sony testers, providing them with the necessary knowledge and daily test plans to integrate seamlessly into our workflow.
* **Developed Remote Testing Resources:** To overcome the challenges of working with the Liverpool team, I created robust testing guides in Confluence that served as a single source of truth for test cases and project knowledge.
* **Championed Lore Consistency:** I meticulously tested all narrative paths and permutations, flagging inconsistencies with the original *Until Dawn* story. I successfully advocated for several changes to be made, ensuring the final product would meet fan expectations.

### Impact & Results
* My rapid mastery of the VR platform was recognized by designers and producers, establishing me as a reliable and key member of the QA team for future VR projects.
* My leadership and coordination efforts **successfully integrated external testers into the team**, increasing testing bandwidth and efficiency during a critical phase of the project.
* The detailed test plans I created in Confluence **enabled effective collaboration with the remote team**, ensuring consistent testing quality across multiple sites.
* My keen attention to narrative detail was praised by colleagues and **directly contributed to a more coherent and faithful prequel**, which was crucial for satisfying the loyal *Until Dawn* fanbase.
