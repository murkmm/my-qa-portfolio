**Company:** Supermassive Games

### Project Overview
*Man of Medan* was the first installment in The Dark Pictures Anthology, a series of standalone, cinematic horror games designed as spiritual successors to *Until Dawn*. The project's goal was to deliver shorter, more frequent narrative experiences where player choice had severe consequences. The game was developed for PC, Xbox One, PS4, and as a launch title for the Google Stadia streaming platform.

### My Role & Responsibilities
I returned to Supermassive Games as a full time employee for this project, taking on significant new responsibilities. My key duties included:
* **Stadia Platform Lead:** I was personally tasked with leading all testing efforts for the Google Stadia version. This involved in depth research into the new platform's unique technical and compliance requirements.
* **Complex Multiplayer QA:** I was responsible for testing the game's three distinct modes: singleplayer, 2 player online co-op, and a 5 player local "Movie Night" mode.
* **External Team Coordination:** I acted as a primary point of contact for the external QA team from Pole To Win, including onboarding and leading two of their testers who were embedded with our on site team.
* **Test Case & Automation Development:** I balanced my testing duties with writing complex test cases in Excel to cover the game's vast number of narrative permutations and began developing my skills in test automation by setting up basic playthrough scripts.

### The Challenge
The main challenge was the sheer scope of the test matrix. We had to ensure a consistent experience across three different game modes, each with a branching narrative, on four separate platforms, including the brand new and unfamiliar Stadia. Coordinating with an external QA partner while simultaneously onboarding new team members added another layer of logistical complexity.

### Gameplay Highlights

Here is a highlight of the multiplayer mode that I was responsible for testing.

### My Approach & Actions
* **Became a Stadia Expert:** I thoroughly researched and mastered Google's compliance and technical requirements for Stadia, establishing the test plans for that platform.
* **Managed a Hybrid Team:** I successfully onboarded the embedded testers from Pole To Win and coordinated with their off site team, ensuring clear communication and consistent testing standards.
* **Authored Comprehensive Test Documentation:** I wrote and maintained detailed test cases in Excel and playthrough guides in Confluence to manage the complex testing requirements of the branching story.
* **Pioneered Automation Efforts:** I took the initiative to dabble in test automation, setting up scripts to perform automatic playthroughs, which helped streamline some of the more repetitive testing tasks.
* **Maintained High Bug Output:** Despite balancing test case writing and team coordination, I consistently logged the most bugs within the embedded QA team.

### Impact & Results
* Demonstrated my ability to **master and lead testing for an emerging platform**, delivering a high quality and compliant build for the Google Stadia launch.
* My effective coordination with the Pole To Win team **created a seamless and productive partnership**, allowing us to meet tight deadlines.
* The robust test documentation I created **became a key resource for the entire QA effort**, ensuring all permutations of the story were thoroughly tested.
* Recognized for my high personal bug finding rate, I consistently logged **the most bugs within the embedded QA team**, showcasing a thorough and detail oriented approach to testing.

### Technologies & Tools Used
* **Jira** (for bug tracking and reporting)
* **Microsoft Excel** (for test cases and checklists)
* **Confluence** (for test plans and QA knowledge base)
* **Unreal Engine 4**
* Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, & PC
* **Proprietary Supermassive Games debug tools**
