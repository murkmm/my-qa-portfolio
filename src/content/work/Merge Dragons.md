### Project Overview
*Merge Dragons!* is a hugely popular, free-to-play mobile puzzle game with a massive global player base. In my role as a Senior Mobile QA Tester at Unity, I was embedded with the live-service team to lead QA efforts, ensuring the ongoing stability and performance of the title through its frequent updates.

### My Role & Responsibilities
I led the QA efforts for the project on both iOS and Android. This involved designing and implementing detailed test plans focused on mobile-specific performance metrics like memory usage and battery consumption, ensuring compliance with App Store and Google Play requirements, and mentoring junior QA testers.

### The Challenge
The greatest challenge of working on a major live-service title is ensuring that every update is stable and performant for millions of active players across thousands of different devices. This requires an incredibly rigorous and efficient testing process to catch any potential issues before they go live.

### My Approach & Actions

* I conducted device compatibility testing across a wide range of screen sizes, OS versions, and hardware to ensure a consistent user experience.
* I drove specific testing sessions to uncover hidden issues and assess the quality of the player experience in real-world scenarios.
* I mentored junior members of the QA team, promoting best practices in mobile testing and bug reporting.

### Impact & Results

* My thorough compliance testing **ensured that the game consistently met Apple App Store and Google Play requirements**, leading to smooth update releases.
* The mentorship I provided **improved the skills and standards of the junior members of the team.**
