**Company:** Unity

### Project Overview
My work at Unity also included testing the mobile version of the massively popular battle royale game, *Fall Guys*. As a Senior Mobile QA Tester, I was responsible for managing the entire end-to-end testing workflow, from analyzing initial requirements to providing final sign-off for release.

### My Role & Responsibilities
I managed the full testing lifecycle, which involved designing detailed test plans, conducting extensive device compatibility and fragmentation testing, and generating comprehensive QA reports for stakeholders to support go/no-go release decisions.

### The Challenge
The main challenge was ensuring that the fast-paced, physics-based gameplay of *Fall Guys* felt responsive and fair on a huge variety of mobile hardware with different screen sizes and performance capabilities. Device fragmentation was a key risk that required a robust and well-managed testing strategy.

### My Approach & Actions
* I managed the end-to-end testing workflow, ensuring full test coverage and alignment with development milestones.
* I performed extensive compatibility and fragmentation testing across a wide range of iOS and Android devices, OS versions, and hardware specs.
* I designed specific test cases to target mobile performance, including memory usage, battery consumption, and input responsiveness.
* I generated detailed QA reports and dashboards that provided stakeholders with actionable insights into the build's quality and release readiness.

### Impact & Results
* My rigorous compatibility testing **ensured a consistent and high-quality user experience** across the widest possible range of mobile devices.
* The comprehensive QA reports I provided **enabled stakeholders to make informed, data-driven go/no-go decisions** for release candidates.
* My management of the end-to-end testing workflow **ensured that the mobile version of this high-profile IP met its quality targets.**

### Technologies & Tools Used
* **Jira** (for bug tracking and reporting)
* **Confluence** (for test documentation)
* **Unity Engine**
* **iOS & Android mobile devices**
* **Performance & Profiling Tools**
